The bucket assigning, is actually just assigning one variable to another: 

var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "i am a";

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " string!";

console.log(a, b, c);

Output is: 6 / 15 / "I am a string"

Redeclaring a variable:

var n;

var n;

The variable var can be redeclared

const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";
The console will display an error due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET.

The console will display an error, due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET.

Remainder/modulo usage is just for checking a odd number of something really, on anything seems like.


----

Using bracket notation to find the last character in the string you can also use .length - 1:
Const myStr = 'midick';
Const firstletter = firstletter[midick.lenght -5];

This will return the length and with the math  will output the desired letter, the first letter "m".

 when using a bracket notation to look to an data. Instead of just the normal for eg: 
Const myStr = 'midic'
Const var = secondLetter[1]
